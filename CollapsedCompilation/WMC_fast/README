SDD Library with a modified Weighted Model Count engine.

Computing derivatives of all variables now takes time O(S+n) instead of O(S*n), where S = size of SDD, n = # of variables.

The changes can be found in the file 'src/sdds/wmc.c' and 'sdd.h'.

Tests can be found in the directory 'test/', and can be invoked by doing:

scons
cd test
./run
