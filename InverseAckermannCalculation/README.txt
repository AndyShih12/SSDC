Experimental code for calculating the inverse ackermann of an integer N.
There is some discussion of this on Page 8 of 
https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~chazelle/pubs/ComputPartialSumsMultiArrays.pdf

To run, do
./run.sh
and then enter an integer N.

May run into SegFaults due to stack size, so may need to increase the ulimit value in run.sh accordingly.
